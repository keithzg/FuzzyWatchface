# Fuzzy Watchface for Wear OS

## Hi!
Is your fancy smartwatch doing too good of a job telling you the actual time? Are all the watchface options out there too cluttered and busy? Would you rather your watchface be delightfully vague and minimal? Well you've come to the right place!

## TODO
* Actually be able to configure things (look it's weirdly hard okay?)
* If I leave the watch for a while and look back at it, the text _is_ actually aligned perfectly in the center vertically, but then when I tap the screen and it turns back on everything shifts down slightly, what's _that_ about?
* I should use https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/downloadable-fonts.html rather than bundling fonts
* Use Github issues instead of writing a todo list in my readme for some reason
